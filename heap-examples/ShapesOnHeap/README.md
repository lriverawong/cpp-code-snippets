# Shapes
Uses the Shapes example again. Although this time it expands on it
 using inheritance, and the heap.

More specifically it uses the following components:
- The Big 3:
    - if a class defines a destructor, constructor and 
    copy assignment operator â€“ then it should explicitly 
    define these and not rely on their default implementation.
    - copy constructor
    - destructor
    - copy assignment operator
- Namespaces
- conversion constructor
