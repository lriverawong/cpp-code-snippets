Order of tests:

See the warnings if you don't have a virtual destructor in a base class.
Fix!

See what happens when derived classes don't implement the pure virtual function.
Implement it in Rectangle only.

See what happens if the base class remains abstract.
Make the pure virtual function just virtual.
Implement the virtual function for Shape (uncomment the code).

Get rid of attempted call to hidden function.
